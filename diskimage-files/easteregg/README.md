# Easter egg files

These two files are included as a small Easter egg in the Finally Free edition.

It is an old prototype of a game.
The most interesting part in the code is probably the Bresenham's Circle Drawing Algorithm.
It is included as easter egg so that a more substantial example of Z80 assembly
code was available for people who want to follow the (coming soon)
introduction to Compass on YouTube.

## To compile

If you know how to use compass:
 - load the asm or asc file in compass
 - set label length to 20
 - set upper case on
 - assemble to disk

## To start the game

First assemble to game and then in an (emulated) MSX2 or higher
 - go to basic
 - bload"chain.bin",r

## Improvements are welcome

The game is a prototype so...
 - Code readability wasn't a priority.
 - There are still graphical glitches in there.
 - It is only controlled by the cursor keys.
 - The sound of silence is very present.
 - Gameplay isn't balanced at all.

People who feel like improving this prototype are free to do so. :-)
